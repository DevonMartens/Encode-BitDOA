# Homework 8 - Interacting with NFT’s

---

### Interact with a smart contract
1. Develop a front-end application that can call on a smart contract to mint an ERC721 token (NFT). Include relevant metadata in the token:
1. Owner (pubkey)
2. Token URI (e.g. an IPFS CID) 3. Token ID
2. Retrieve information regarding an account’s NFT’s 1. Display NFT metadata
3. Allow transfer of NFT 1. Apply safe transfer
2. Trade for zero cost?
4. Use smart contract from Homework 6
5. Use front-end code from Homework 7
6. Deploy on a test net

### Recap
* DApps offer the benefits of interacting with blockchains to existing and novel services.
* A multitude of ideas are being tested and trialled with the optimal model for each application being determined via trial and error.
* DApps must try to improve on the UX on top of offering novel features to be successful.
